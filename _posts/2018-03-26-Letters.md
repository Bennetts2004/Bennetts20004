Today we were going to start working on letters letters where different because not all the angles where the same. This meant that we had to wright out all the code ourselves making sure everything was alright and had the wright measurements. We all started with  an letter A. Here is the code to do it:

def draw_A():

 turtle.left(75)

 turtle.forward(250)

 turtle.right(150)

 turtle.forward(250)

 turtle.backward(75)

 turtle.right(105)

 turtle.forward(70)

draw_A()

Here is what it all meant:

We are using draw_A() as our variable but the computer doesnt know what it means so you have to define what it means underneath we put what the turtle needs to do to draw the letter A. The way you do t is very simple for you use forward, backward, right and left. After you have have finished you need to put draw_A() so it will actually draw. Next week we are making letters look better including filling it and making it 3D.
