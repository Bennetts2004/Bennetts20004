Today in class we started working on a way to employ customers and find out how much we make per week, month, and year but also find out what we lost. This was harder than it sound because we had to build another table which held: 

* Item 

* Price sold for

* Price bought for

* How many left in stock (per month)

* How many sold (per month)

* A percentage of stock left

* If we need more or buy less.

For me this got quite confusing and I made lots of the same thing but finally I managed to get it into three tables.
