Today we changed over to using coding but first we had a talked about taking computer science for GCSE. Our teacher explained the weaknesses and advantages of the subject and who should take it. He then told us that we would have to take it to the end of the year even after we get put in our GCSE options. After the talk we started working on a programme called repl.it we started messing about with the turtle draw tool and began working out how to draw angles and make calculations. We started off with a triangle and then a square.
